## Task 5: Reflections on the Technical Issues/Challenges
Over the course of the two semesters, you should have developed technical and practical skills, and
you should have used Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and other technical and practical programming tools
as part of the COM4043 module as well as other modules in the programme.
Reflect on a range of technical issues consisting of installations, setting up accounts, configuring
compilers and IDEs, identifying errors, and debugging.
